Before making the programs, set the number of OMP_NUM_THREADS to specify the number of threads

Four versions of CFD:

euler3d_cpu <-- redundant flux computation (CPU)   
euler3d_cpu_double <-- redundant flux computation double precision (CPU)
pre_euler3d_cpu <-- pre-computed fluxes (CPU)
pre_euler3d_cpu_double <-- pre-computed fluxes double precision (CPU)

The original OpenMP and CUDA codes for CFD were obtained from Andrew Corrigan at George Mason University, 
who has given us permission to include it as part of Rodinia under Rodinia's license.
